 *
 * Every list page is loaded twice: once with a little data, once with much
 * more. The number of database queries must be the same both times. A page
 * that runs one extra query per row (the "N+1" problem) would be fine in a
 * demo and slow to a crawl after a busy season; this test catches it.
 *
 * Phase 20 found two such pages (owner rooms and owner availability) and
 * fixed them; this test keeps them fixed.
