 * guard: the picker's own minimum never moved.
 *
 * The box was built with min="tomorrow" once, when the page was
 * rendered. A guest arriving in March could pick a check-out in
 * January and the browser would accept it; only the server said no,
 * after the whole form had been filled in and sent. The minimum now
 * follows the arrival date.
