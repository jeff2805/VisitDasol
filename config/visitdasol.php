    | A point per barangay, so a visitor can see the shape of the municipality

    |
    | PROVENANCE MATTERS HERE, so every entry says where its number came from:
    |
    |   'place'     the barangay itself is mapped in OpenStreetMap. Trustworthy.
    |   'landmark'  OpenStreetMap has no point for the barangay, so this is the
    |               elementary school that carries its name. Schools sit in the
    |               built-up part of a barangay, so it is a fair guide and
    |               nothing more. Shown to visitors as approximate.
    |   null        nothing could be confirmed. The barangay is simply left off
    |               the map rather than guessed at, because a wrong pin on a
    |               municipal site is worse than no pin.
    |
    | Five are blank on purpose: Alilao and San Vicente are not in OpenStreetMap
    | at all, and Hermosa, Magsaysay and Osmeña matched a school whose name does
    | not carry the barangay's, so there is no way to tell from here whether it
    | stands in the right place.
    |
    | THE OFFICE SHOULD CORRECT THESE. Anyone who knows Dasol can read a pin off
    | the coordinate picker on the tourist spot form and paste it in below, then
    | change 'landmark' to 'office' so the map stops calling it approximate.
