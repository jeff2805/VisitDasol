     * PayMongo configured, has the resort set up a GCash account — and
     * whether the resort's payment terms ALLOW it for this booking.
     * Manual GCash was once offered by resorts asking for no deposit
     * at all, sending the guest to collect a reference number and
     * upload a receipt for a payment nobody wanted yet.
     *
     * THIS IS THE ONE GATE. The booking form draws what it returns,
     * StoreBookingRequest accepts what it returns, and BookingService
     * refuses anything else against the real terms. A method withdrawn
     * here is withdrawn everywhere, which is why "Pay at the resort"
     * needed no change to a view, a route or a rule.
     *
     * $terms is optional, and with none the answers are about the site
     * rather than one stay: a report, a seeder, a screen listing what
     * exists. Every caller deciding for a real booking passes them.
